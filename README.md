# My dotfiles

This is a constantly updated list of my dotfiles and must have VS Code extenstions.

For quick installation of dev dependencies:

```
npm i -D eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks prettier
```

## Setting up a new Mac
Simply run the `startup.sh` script in this repo:
```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crustan/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)
```

## VS Code Settings and Extensions
Syncing of settings and extensions for VS Code is no longer made with the Settings Sync extension, but is now made with the built-in sync functionality in VS Code.
